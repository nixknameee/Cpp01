# C++ Module 01 Project README

## Overview
This project, part of the C++ Module 01, focuses on introducing and reinforcing concepts in memory allocation, pointers to members, references, and switch statements in C++.

## Prerequisites
- **Compilation**: Code must compile with C++ and flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
- **Standard**: Follow the C++98 standard; avoid C++11 and later features.

## Forbidden Practices
- Functions implemented in header files (except templates).
- Makefiles not compiling with required flags or using compilers other than C++.
- Use of forbidden functions or keywords (`*alloc`, `*printf`, `free`, `using namespace`, `friend`).
- Use of external libraries or non-C++98 features.

## Exercises

### Exercise 00: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ
- Focus: Memory allocation in C++.
- Key Components: `Zombie` class with private attributes, constructors, and member functions.

### Exercise 01: Moar brainz!
- Focus: Allocating multiple objects simultaneously.
- Key Components: `zombieHorde` function using `new[]`.

### Exercise 02: HI THIS IS BRAIN
- Focus: Demystifying references.
- Key Components: Manipulating a string using pointers and references.

### Exercise 03: Unnecessary violence
- Focus: Differences between pointers and references.
- Key Components: `Weapon`, `HumanA`, and `HumanB` classes.

### Exercise 04: Sed is for losers
- Focus: File manipulation.
- Key Components: String replacement in a file using `ifstream` and `ofstream`.

### Exercise 05: Harl 2.0
- Focus: Pointers to class member functions.
- Key Components: `Harl` class with various log levels.

### Exercise 06: Harl filter
- Focus: Using switch statements.
- Key Components: Filtering messages in `harlFilter` based on log levels.
